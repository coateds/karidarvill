              <p>My love for teaching, languages, and the outdoors was fostered
                  early on by my family.&nbsp; My father wrote trail guides and
                  maintained lookouts.&nbsp; Both of my parents loved adventures and
                  achieving goals.&nbsp; My grandmother was a teacher and highly
                  interested in Spanish since my grandfather had Mexican
                  relatives.&nbsp; My second language was Spanish, and I went to live
                  in Spain to become fluent.&nbsp; I met many people from other
                  countries sparking my interest in learning more languages, and I
                  basically taught myself German, Japanese, and a bit of French.&nbsp;
                  I loved living in Spain, Germany, and Japan and hope one day to live
                  in a French speaking country to improve my fluency in that language.</p>
                <p>I was out in the mountains before I could walk and spent many hours
                  every summer working in the lookouts with my parents.&nbsp; One time
                  at Park Butte LO, we were caught in a lightning storm.&nbsp; I
                  remember being terrified as my dad placed us on the insulated stool
                  while lightning struck all around us.&nbsp; My dad's hair was
                  standing straight up.&nbsp; I couldn't have been much more than
                  four,&nbsp; It did not dim my love for lookouts, and I continue to
                  be a steward by serving as Vice President for the Friends of Hidden
                  Lake Lookout.&nbsp; I also try to get to as many lookouts and former
                  lookout sites as possible.&nbsp; I hit 83 the summer of 2017.&nbsp;
                  Additionally, I have visited lookouts in other states.</p>
                <p>I ran my own meetup for several years but recently I am an
                  assistant organizer for several of them =both social and
                  outdoors.&nbsp; During that time, I have introduced many to
                  backpacking and snowshoeing and even some to day hiking.&nbsp; It is
                  a joy to spread my enthusiasm for trails and preserving them for the
                  future.&nbsp; Most recently, I have begun leading and instructing
                  for the Mountaineers.</p>
                <p>Ideally, one day I would like to combine outdoor and international
                  education into a paying job.</p>
