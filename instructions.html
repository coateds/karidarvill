<!--
  Definitions:  Website Root: a website typically contains a series of folders/directories to 
  organize web pages. (This is not technically necessary, just helpful because  trying to find a particular page in a single massive folder can be difficult)
  The first/initial folder/directory that contains all of the other folders is  called the root. We also think of this as the top of the folder structure.
  It is common in computer speak to say "go up" a folder. This means to get one
  step closer to the root. (or to go to the root) Conversely, we speak of "going  down" into a sub folder.
  Topic Folder/Directory: This is my term for a sub folder of the root that contains related
  pages pertaining to a single topic. My resume pages or the Sequim house for instance.  Not all sub folders from the root are going to be topic folders. The images
  folder, for instance, is a sub folder of the root, but not a topic folder.
  Template (template.html): the root and the topic-template folder/directory each   contain this file. A copy of this file should be made and then renamed within the 
  root or an existing topic folder/directory.
  Side Menu (sidemenu.html): This html file is "included" in each file for a  given folder/directory. More precisely, it is called out in an inline frame.
  <iframe src="sidemenu.html" ...></iframe>
  Windows Explorer = File Explorer: This is the application launched with the   folder icon that lets you copy and/or move files from a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  Internet Explorer = Edge = Browser = Chrome etc: An application that interprets html
  and presents the page the way we want it to look.
  Text Editor/WYSIWYG html editor (Blue Griffon): A (potentially) very long list of applications that  let us create/edit/change the html. For now we are using Blue Griffon.
  Should a process for making a copy of a template and renaming it be included here?
    Three processes
  1) Create a new page in the root folder/directory (from template)  2) Create a new topic (from template)
  3) Create a new topic page (from template)
  1) Create a new page in the root directory  This is a page that can be reached directly from every other page in the website
  The side menu for the root and every topic will contain a link to this page  Examples may include the main home page, about and site map. There are specific 
  instructions included at the top of the template.html.    a) Copy the template.html in the root directory
    b) Paste the template.html in the root directory    c) Rename the resultant (copy) of the template.html in the root directory
    d) Start editing the renamed file (instructions included)    e) Create a link button in the root sidemenu.html (instructions needed?)
    f) Create a link button in the sidemenu.html in every Topic Folder/Directory
  2) Create a new topic  A topic is a collection of related pages that are kept in a single folder/directory
  The side menu of a topic will "expand" that topic to display link buttons for all  of the pages in that topic.
  A topic-template folder/directory is included. The instructions.html page within the 
  topic-template will provide the procedure to copy and modify the topic-template-->
