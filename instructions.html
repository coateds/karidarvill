<!--
  Definitions:
  Template (template.html): the root and the topic-template folder/directory each 
  contain this file. A copy of this file should be made and then renamed within the 
  root or an existing topic folder/directory.

  Side Menu (sidemenu.html): This html file is "included" in each file for a
  given folder/directory. More precisely, it is called out in an inline frame.
  <iframe src="sidemenu.html" ...></iframe>

  Should a process for making a copy of a template and renaming it be included here?
  
  Three processes
  1) Create a new page in the root folder/directory (from template)
  2) Create a new topic (from template)
  3) Create a new topic page (from template)

  Create a new page in the root directory
  This is a page that can be reached directly from every other page in the website
  The side menu for the root and every topic will contain a link to this page
  Examples may include the main home page, about and site map. There are specific 
  instructions included at the top of the template.html.
