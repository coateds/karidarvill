        <div>This lookout was built in 1931 as part of a Forest Service Program
          to spot fires early.&nbsp; The lookout was manned until 1958.&nbsp; In          the 1960s, the Forest Service became concerned about unmaintained
          lookouts becoming a liability issue and burned many of them          down.&nbsp; Dr. Fred Darvill and others attempted to adopt several
          lookouts to prevent them from being torched.&nbsp; This was one of          their successful endeavors.&nbsp; In 1961, Dr. Darvill and the Skagit
          Alpine Club he founded obtained a special use permit to restore and          maintain the lookout.&nbsp; He maintained the lookout for many years
          until he was no longer able to do so.&nbsp; At that time, Robert          Kendall took over the main stewardship role in cooperation with the
          Forest Service.</div>

        <div>As part of following her father's legacy, Kari Darvill put together
          a Facebook page for the lookout several years ago, and his widow,          Ginny Darvill, took over the finances.&nbsp; Kari will post
          information about work parties and needs for the lookout on that          page.&nbsp; www.facebook.com/Friends-of-Hidden-Lake-Lookout-116648781729929/</div>

          labor contributions.&nbsp; Leave a message on the Facebook page if you          notice anything the lookout needs or would like to contribute physical
          labor as needed.&nbsp; You may also contact Kari at          kariduna@outlook.com or Dave at coateds@outlook.com.</div>
