              I chose to make Park Butte a category of its own because it is extremely special to me.&nbsp; I spent many nights up there as a child with my family.&nbsp; My father, Dr. Fred Darvill, had taken over maintenance of this lookout, and we helped schlep supplies up there, paint, clean, etc. for many years.&nbsp; </div><div><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lookout was built in 1932 and is now on the register of historic places.&nbsp; My father first visited it in 1957 when the trail to get </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was much longer than it is now.&nbsp; He recalled that when he arrived in the meadow below the lookout, the lookout spotted him </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and came down to offer to carry his pack if he would just come up and stay with him as he apparently had not seen anyone for a </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long period of time and was desperate for company.&nbsp; Not so these days - that kind of solitude up there is no longer possible as it</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has become an incredibly popular destination.&nbsp; The trail is 3 miles and about 2800 gain and covers enchanting, iconic scenery.&nbsp; The </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lookout is first come first served, but don't expect to ever have it to yourself.&nbsp; You will likely need to share.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lookout is currently being maintained by the Skagit Alpine Club (which my father founded) in cooperation with the U.S.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forest Service.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be adding pictures from the "old days" up there as a family as well as some newer photos.</div>
