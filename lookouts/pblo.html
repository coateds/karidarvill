              <p>I chose to make Park Butte a category of its own because it is extremely special to me.&nbsp; I spent many nights up there as a child with my family.&nbsp; 
              My father, Dr. Fred Darvill, had taken over maintenance of this lookout, and we helped schlep supplies up there, paint, clean, etc. for many years.</p>
              
              <p>The lookout was built in 1932 and is now on the register of historic places.&nbsp; My father first visited it in 1957 when the trail to get
              there was much longer than it is now.&nbsp; He recalled that when he arrived in the meadow below the lookout, the lookout spotted him
              and came down to offer to carry his pack if he would just come up and stay with him as he apparently had not seen anyone for a
              long period of time and was desperate for company.&nbsp; Not so these days - that kind of solitude up there is no longer possible as it
              has become an incredibly popular destination.&nbsp; The trail is 3 miles and about 2800 gain and covers enchanting, iconic scenery.&nbsp; The
              lookout is first come first served, but don't expect to ever have it to yourself.&nbsp; You will likely need to share.</p>

              <p>The lookout is currently being maintained by the Skagit Alpine Club (which my father founded) in cooperation with the U.S.
              Forest Service.</p>

              <p>I will be adding pictures from the "old days" up there as a family as well as some newer photos.</p>
