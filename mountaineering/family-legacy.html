            <!-- start of content column: insert your content here -->My family was instrumental in developing for love for the outdoors.&nbsp; 
            My father caught Mountain Fever in 1957.&nbsp; He then raised us as a hiking/backpacking/river running family.&nbsp; 
            We spent many summer weekends taking care of Park Butte Lookout and some weekends at Hidden Lake Lookout as well.&nbsp; 
            My father was always doing research for the trail guides he was writing so every weekend and vacation was a hiking one.&nbsp; 
            As a child, I wasn't always thrilled with that!&nbsp; I did the Yosemite Circuit and part of the John Muir Trail when I was 8.&nbsp; 
            I remember hating a lot of it.&nbsp; How I long to go back now that I have the fever in my blood!!&nbsp; <br><br>
            I seem to have an innate ability to spot unsigned trails and routes and to instinctively know where to go.&nbsp; Of course, I spend time 
            looking at maps and always knowing where I am on the map, but somehow I know the terrain well enough to spot routes.&nbsp; This
            probably comes from going off trail as a child, but I tend to have a good sense of direction everywhere except in cities with lots
            of tunnels!</div>
