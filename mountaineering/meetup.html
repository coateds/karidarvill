          About 11 years ago, I realized that my parents were aging and couldn't be my hiking, backpacking, 
            snowshoeing partners on more challenging trips anymore so I started looking for places to find outdoor partners.&nbsp; 
            I found nwhikers.net and met some women from there who are still my outdoor friends.&nbsp; I was always the organizer, 
            and I kept finding that people wouldn't read the email about the trip or delete it, and I was fielding so many 
            questions constantly that it interfered with work and family life.&nbsp; Someone told my about meetup.&nbsp; 
            I was resistant at first because I had to pay to have a group there, but eventually, it just made more sense to 
            have a site where I could type up all the info, post pictures, and direct people to go back and read it before 
            asking questions about details already outlined.&nbsp; I had my own group for several years and led 1-2 outings per week.&nbsp; 
            It became a bit much as co-organizers weren't doing anything.&nbsp; It was hard to get any monetary contributions either 
            so I switched to becoming an assistant organizer.
            <br>
            <br>

            Between organizing for several groups including a couple of dance ones, I have organized 600 meetup outings.&nbsp; These consist 
            of day hikes or snowshoe outings, multi-night backpacking trips, and weekends based at my beach house which include the need 
            to organize food and sleeping arrangements.
            <br>
            <br>

            Back when meetup had organizer ratings, I had highly positive reviews.<br>
