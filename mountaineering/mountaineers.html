            <!-- start of content column: insert your content here --> I have been with the Mountaineers off and on for over 15 years.&nbsp; For most of that time, I didn't organize outings as meetup and family were keeping me busy.&nbsp; I went to the lodges and some classes, but that was it.&nbsp; My partner was quite active with the Mountaineers so I began leading outings with them in 2017.&nbsp; I am a hike and backpack leader.&nbsp; Member feedback on my outings has been highly positive.&nbsp; I am working on my Super Volunteer badge this year.</div>
