          <!-- start of content column: insert your content here --> This two
          bedroom house is located on Diamond Point and overlooks a gorgeous
          panorama of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Protection Island, Victoria,
          the Dungeness Lighthouse, Mt. Baker and other mountains.&nbsp; There
          is a community beach usable by my guests.&nbsp; You can walk for miles
          on the beach when the tide is out.&nbsp; There are always eaglesflying
          around as well as seals, deer, and other wildlife to see - sometimes
          even Orcas! <br>
          <br>
          The house has everything one could need to be comfortable.&nbsp; There
          is a King bed in the master along with a pullout queen, and a queen in
          the small bedroom.&nbsp; There is also a full bathroom on the second
          floor.&nbsp; You can hear the waves and watch the sunrise on Baker
          from the master bedroom.&nbsp; There are lots of books for your
          reading pleasure as well as a TV with DVDs and downstairs a Roku with
          a couple of subscription services for your viewing pleasure.&nbsp;
          Additionally, wifi is available - the password is in the instruction
          booklet.&nbsp; We also have children's toys over there though I would
          be cautious about very small children on the deck and bluff
          area.&nbsp; Dogs are a case by case basis.&nbsp; If I know your dog,
          it's fine.&nbsp; I'm a bit leery about agreeing to dogs I don't know
          as the house has nice furniture etc.&nbsp; I don't want things broken
          or chewed up etc.<br>
          <br>
          Downstairs is a fully equipped kitchen, dining and living area, half
          bath, and good sized deck with a gas and charcoal grill.&nbsp; There
          is a fireplace and plenty of wood as well as an outdoor firepit -
          please be cognizant of burn bans most summers.&nbsp; There is a table
          and set of six chairs outside as well as other deck chairs.&nbsp; The
          dining table has four main chairs and other chairs you can use to
          supplement.&nbsp; We can easily get eight people around the table.<br>
          <br>
          There is a lot of outdoor activities to do in the vicinity = hiking,
          snowshoeing, beach walking, biking etc.&nbsp; Dancing is available
          most weekends to a live band at the casino.&nbsp; Port Townsend is 35
          minutes away and quite interesting to visit.&nbsp; There is a bike
          trail, the Olympic Discovery Trail, at the top of the Diamond Point
          Road.&nbsp; There are often festivals and other events.&nbsp;
          Hurricane Ridge, with its breathtaking views and hiking/snowshoeing
          trails, is about a 75 minute drive one way.&nbsp; Port Angeles is
          about 30 minutes.&nbsp; The Dungeness Spit is about 20 minutes.&nbsp;
          The town of Sequim is around 15 minutes away.<br>
          <br>
          Should you choose to use the house, the address and key code and other
          information will be supplied upon payment.&nbsp; Preferred payment is
          through paypal.&nbsp; You will give us a cost contribution of !00 per
          night for up to 4 people and 125 for 4-8.&nbsp; You must clean up and
          take your own garbage upon departure.&nbsp; Be considerate about
          leaving it in good condition for the next guests.&nbsp; If you don't
          want to do laundry, please bring your own sheets and towels OR your
          own sleeping bags.&nbsp; You will also sign a "use at your own risk"
          agreement.&nbsp; Exercise normal caution around the bluff.&nbsp; Every
          effort has been made to keep the place well maintained and safe.<br>
          <br>
          Your reservation will be secured upon payment.&nbsp; No refunds will
          be given as it is extremely challenging to reschedule.&nbsp; If there
          is a VERIFIED TRUE EMERGENCY, we may be able to reschedule.&nbsp; I
          cannot reschedule if the weather is crummy - no guarantees of sun in
          this part of the world or&nbsp; you just decide not to go because
          something else came up, etc.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Again, more details will be provided in a follow up email should you
          be interested in using the house.<br>
