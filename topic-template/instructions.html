<!--
  Create a topic from this template

  Copy the topic-template folder/directory from the root of the website to the root
  of the website. (include process?) rename the resultant "topic-template - Copy" 
  folder with a suitable topic name.

  If there is a desire for changing the header picture/graphic it can be done for the 
  folder by adjusting the template.html and subject-one,two,three files.  

  Create button links within ALL side menus to the index.html page within the new
  folder. The sequence of headings and button links should remain the same within all
  of the side menu files.
    1) Root Side Menu: Create a Section Header and button link to the index.html page 
    of the new topic. (The href path will be [topic-folder-name]/index.html)
    2) Modify the side menu page of the newly created topic: (href="index.html")
    Move and modify the "Topic Template" section to the desired sequence
    3) Other topic side menus: add the section header and topic index.html page 
    link button to the other topic sidemenu.html pages. (Generally, it will be 
    easiest to copy from the root side menu and adjust the path:  prepend "../" to 
    the href option)
    4) Copy the same content in point 3 to the topic-template side menu. (is this 
    process any different?)

  The index.html page of the new topic should be adjusted like it was a template
  (<head><title>, visible title, content)
  
  Adjust the link buttons subject-one,two,three with new captions and paths
    note the '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' is four spaces to create an 'indent'
  rename/create the pages linked with these buttons
  delete unused or create new buttons as needed
  delete or create new pages as needed (create with the template, instructions included)
